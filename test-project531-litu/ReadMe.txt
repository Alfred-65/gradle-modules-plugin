The purpose of this project is to check how "gradle-modules-plugin" behaves in combination with
Gradle version 5.3.1.

Reason for choosing Gradle version 5.3.1: That is the Gradle version used for building
"gradle-modules-plugin" version 1.6.0 where this contribution is based on.

This project was created by running the "gradle init" task with gradle version 5.3.1.

Names of classes and methods, method signatures and behaviour have been changed (slightly).
